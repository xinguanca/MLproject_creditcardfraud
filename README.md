## Machine Learning Project to Mitigate Credit Card Fraud Issue
This project built a supervised extra tree model to shape the issue and improve recall with a relatively high precision. Achievements are listed below,

* Built a **feature selection** function based on the **correlation coefficient matrix**, which effectively reduced **78%** of the noise (_28 features down to 6_) and maintained the performance
* Data visualization through Seaborn, matplotlib
* Demonstrated Sklearn use cases in model building, evaluation, hyperparameter tuning and pipeline.
