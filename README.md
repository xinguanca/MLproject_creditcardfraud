## Machine Learning Project to Mitigate Credit Card Fraud Issue
This project built a supervised extra tree model to shape the issue and improve recall with a relatively high precision. Achievements are listed below,

* Built a feature selection function based on the correlation coefficient matrix, which effectively reduced **78%** of the noise (_28 features down to 6_) and maintained the performance
* Demonstrated data visualization use cases through Seaborn, matplotlib
* Demonstrated resampling methods use cases, such as SMOTE and Random Sampler
* Demonstrated Sklearn use cases in model building, evaluation, hyperparameter tuning and pipeline
* Demonstrated Autoencoder, UMAP and Plotly use cases
